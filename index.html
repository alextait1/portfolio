						<p class="p__one">I wrote my first "hello world" html program in a plain text document in the summer of 2016 and was instantly hooked. On the one hand, I couldn't believe that making something display in a browser was actually as easy as writing a sentence. On the other hand, I realized immediately that if I wanted to make anything good, I would need to dive into a deep world of knowledge and practice.</p>
						<p class="p__two">Coming from a background as a musician, the idea of practicing my skills and getting better with each iteration was something familar and exciting. And the paralells I began to see between composing music and composing websites has kept me passionatey learning and trying to level up my abilities in order to understand and tap into the alchemy of programming.</p>

					<h3 class="aboutMe__text-heading">How I Found Code</h3>
					<p>My web development journey began with building and maintaining a few Squarespace websites for bands I have worked with. In doing that I quickly felt limited by the parameters of the basic platform. I started doing online coding turorials like Skill Crush and Code Academy and got really into it. I decided to enrole in Hacker You's part-time web development class in the fall of 2016 and that was the game changer for me. I felt so empowered and excieted by the things I was learning and applying, and I was hungry for more.</p>
					<p class="p__two-about">I wrapped up my teaching business permanently in the spring of 2017 and as of July was attending Hacker You's full-time immersive web development bootcamp, which was just the kickstart I needed to hone my skills and get fully hooked on coding!</p>

					<h3 class="interests__text-heading">Interests</h3>
					<p>I am highly profficient with HTML and CSS and my JavaScript/react are getting stronger every day. In terms of my long-term career vision, I am very interested in UX/UI and product design and development. My dream job would be on a team with great culture, where my exisiting skillset would be useful and where I would have some room to grow into new skills too.</p>
					<p class="p__two-about">I'm currently seeking a full-time front-end web development position here in Toronto for the fall of 2017.</p>
